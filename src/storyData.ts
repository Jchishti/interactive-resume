      text: `During the fall term of my senior year at Oregon State, I interviewed with a company based in Colorado. I did so well, they said they wanted to fly me out to the office and interview with the team. My not-quite-fully-developed-22-year-old brain didn't really want to live in Colorado. I wanted to live in California after I graduated. So, I gave them a "Thanks, but no thanks." I thought if it was that easy to get a job, I wouldn't have any problems by graduation. It was 2009.`,

I vividly remember doing a closed-eye exercise where we were told to envision walking across the podium to get our diploma. It felt like a million miles away.`,
